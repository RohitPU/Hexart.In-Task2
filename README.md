Train and Give Inputs to Identify rocks and mines

Identifying rocks and mines using Logistic Regression involves building a binary classification model to determine whether a given object is a rock or a mine. The inputs to the model are features extracted from sensor readings that detect the object. These features can include information such as the size, shape, texture, and reflection patterns of the object. The data is collected and labeled as either a rock or a mine, and then split into training and testing sets. The training data is used to fit the logistic regression model, which uses statistical techniques to learn the relationship between the inputs and the binary output. The model is then evaluated on the testing data to assess its performance in accurately classifying rocks and mines. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in determining whether a given object is a rock or a mine based on its features.
